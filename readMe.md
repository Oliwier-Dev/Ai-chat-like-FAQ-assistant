# AI Chat-like FAQ Assistant

This is a side project I made for my portfolio and to learn more about JS and JSON.  
It’s basically a simple AI-like assistant that answers questions about a business, product, or service.  

You can try it live here: [Live Demo](https://oliwier-dev.github.io/Ai-chat-like-FAQ-assistant/)

## How it works

- All the questions and answers are stored in `kb.JSON`.  
- The script matches your question with the closest keywords in the JSON and shows the answer.  
- You can customize it by editing the text inside `kb.JSON`.  

**Note:**  
Do **not** change the individual keys like `id`, `keywords`, `question`, or `answer`. Only change the text inside otherwise, the code may break.

## How to use

1. Open the live demo link or run it locally by opening `index.html`.  
2. Type your question in the input box.  
3. The assistant will show the most relevant answers from the knowledge base.
