AI FAQ Assistant

This is a side project I made for learning and for my portfolio.
It’s a chat where you can ask questions about any business, product, or service, and it will respond based on a JSON knowledge base. You can change it to anything you want by editing the text in kb.JSON.

⚠ Important: Don’t change field names like "id" or "keywords". Only edit the text inside them.
